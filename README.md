# **ARIMA Model for Financial Predictions**



This repository contains an implementation of an ARIMA model, specifically designed for predicting the prices of financial instruments such as currencies, stocks, and cryptocurrencies. The ARIMA model leverages sequential data to capture temporal dependencies in price movements. This approach enhances the accuracy and robustness of price forecasts across various datasets.

This is the original code sample for the ARIMA model. Explore my GitHub repository for additional models and implementations that cater to different financial prediction needs.
